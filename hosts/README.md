# Hosts

Host adapters are **separate repositories** that consume `mu-core`. This repo
ships the pure core only and contains no host crates. Planned hosts:

- game server — SpacetimeDB module
- clients — Unity (iOS, Android, WebGL) via a C-ABI FFI shim, and browser wasm

A host is a thin translation layer around the core:

1. **Parse** raw input (packets, rows, engine calls) into typed domain intents
   at the boundary — once.
2. **Call** core services with the intent plus current state.
3. **Persist** the returned state.
4. **Deliver** the returned events (log, packet, table update, callback).

Hosts own I/O, persistence, networking, the clock, and the RNG seed. No game
rule is ever implemented in a host, and `mu-core` never depends on a host.

## Anti-cheat duties

Client proposes, server decides. Two layers:

**Core already checks single-action legality — don't redo it.** Distance/range,
reachability, ≤1-tile step + no wall-tunnelling, target/cost/eligibility, all
damage/drop/kill. So "buy from far" and "teleport" are already rejected. The host just
calls core and honours the rejection.

**Host owns rate + identity** (core is clockless, can't see them):

1. Per-tick action budget — one action per tick; advance on the *server's* clock, not
   on message arrival. (Stops the "Flash" cheat: many legal moves sent too fast.)
2. Drop out-of-order / too-frequent requests.
3. Admit only live, authenticated actors (the dead-actor gate).
4. Bind the intent to the authenticated caller.

**SpacetimeDB:** clients can't touch tables — they only call your reducer, which runs
`mu-core` and decides. Each call gives you the caller identity + server timestamp. It
does **not** rate-limit for you — duties 1–2 are reducer code you write.

### PvP (W-PVP)
- Stamp each `CombatProfile.kind` from the entity type — `Player` from a `Character`,
  `Npc` from a `MonsterInstance` — never from client bytes.
- Translate the client's force-attack modifier (CTRL-click) + selected entity into a
  batch index and pass `Designation::Forced { target_index }`; otherwise `Incidental`.
  Single-target skills (`DirectHit`/`Lunge`) MUST supply `Forced` or the cast rejects
  `NoTargetsInRegion`. Keeping the target batch stable between click and resolution is
  a host duty (like rate-limiting).
- On `TargetHit::Killed` / `AttackOutcome::Killed`, map the index to the entity and route
  by kind: `Npc` → `resolve_kill` (exp/loot); `Player` → `resolve_death(victim, at, tick,
  atlas, combat_death_penalty(attacker_kind))` + `respawn` only (both by value). Pass
  **core's computed** penalty — never a host-originated Waived/Applied literal; the
  rule (a player kill costs the victim nothing) lives in core. Reputation is W-PK.

### PvP reputation (W-PK)
- **Online-time tick.** `now`/`at`/`tick` you feed the reputation services come from a
  per-character **online-time** tick counter that **pauses while the character is offline
  and persists across logout**. This is what makes murderer status decay online-only —
  core is clockless and takes the tick as input; it cannot enforce this, so it is a host
  duty. A wall-clock feed would (wrongly) decay offline time.
- **Decay before the bump.** At an action tick, call `decay_reputation(now)` to bring the
  killer's standing current **before** `player_kill_sanction` + `resolve_player_kill`, so
  the +1h climb accumulates onto a current deadline. Self-correcting if skipped (a stale
  deadline peels on the next decay call) — a cleanliness contract, not a correctness bug.
- **Monster-kill two-step.** On a monster kill: `resolve_kill` (reward) **then**
  `accelerate_reputation_decay` (the killer's fade) — mirrors the `combat_death_penalty`
  + `resolve_death` two-step. Both read the one core-stamped monster.
- **Player-kill routing.** On a `Player` victim: run the victim's
  `resolve_death(.., combat_death_penalty(TargetKind::Player))` (Waived) **and** the
  killer's `player_kill_sanction(victim, context)` + `resolve_player_kill`. Pass core's
  computed sanction — never a client-claimed one.
- **`PvpContext` is attested from SERVER state, never a client byte.** The non-`Open`
  variants (`SelfDefense`/`RivalGuild`/`Duel`/`MiniGamePvp`) come from server-side facts
  — the ~1-min self-defense timer, the guild registry, the duel registry, session
  membership — exactly like `CombatProfile.kind` is stamped "from the entity type… never
  from client bytes". Do **not** wire a client-supplied self-defense flag into the
  sanction. Until W-SELFDEF / W-GUILD / W-DUEL land, supply `Open` (`MiniGamePvp` from
  session membership is available today).
- **Crywolf exp-loss exclusion.** OpenMU skips PK monster-death exp-loss on **map 34
  (Crywolf)** — route it host-side via `DeathPenalty::Waived` (same mechanism as the
  mini-game waiver), no core change.
- **Name-color / murderer marker** is a host/view concern — core owns the `Reputation`
  state; the host maps the stage to a name color.

### Account progression (W-ACCOUNT)
- **`reached` is server-decided, never a client byte.** Call
  `unlock_classes_for_level(unlocked, reached, classes)` only with the `Level` core
  returned as `GrowthEvent::LevelsGained { reached }` from `apply_experience` — never a
  client-claimed level. Core is clockless and roster-less; it cannot verify the
  provenance, exactly as `CombatProfile.kind` is stamped "from the entity type… never
  from client bytes". A forged level would unlock a class unearned.
- **The earned-set is written ONLY through the service.** Persist the `UnlockedClasses`
  the service returns; reconstitute it at account load through its parse gate; never
  write it from a client claim. It is the sole authority the creation gate reads. Compose
  it after every level-up: `apply_experience` → on `LevelsGained { reached }` →
  `unlock_classes_for_level` → persist the returned set + deliver each `ClassUnlocked`.
- **Gate every create-character request with core.** Parse the requested class at the
  boundary (raw class code → `CharacterClass` via `ClassTable::class_by_number`), then
  call `creation_verdict(class, &unlocked, classes)` and create **only** on `Creatable`.
  This is the authoritative enforcement OpenMU left client-side — do not trust a client's
  "I may create this class". The host still owns slot allocation, name validation, and
  seeding stats/inventory/spawn; core owns only the legality verdict.
